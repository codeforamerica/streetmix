It allows patrons to board at the same level as the bus, which speeds up the boarding process (especially for wheelchairs and others with access needs) and shaves crucial seconds off the routes time, all of which add up over time."

But compared with shelters that are at curb height, they tend to be more expensive pieces of infrastructure and take up more space with of wheelchair ramps. This makes it more difficult for BRT services to be provided with as much flexibility as a normal bus service. Furthermore, with low-floor buses becoming increasingly more common, it starts to reduce the need to have higher platforms."
